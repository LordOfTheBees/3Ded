# 3Ded
This project implements a 3d engine using the sfml 2d engine. This project implements an Editor that allows you to view objects loaded objects.

Loading of objects of the .obj type is implemented.

The order in which polygons are drawn is determined by the binary tree.

Sorry for the comments in the project code - they were written in Russian.
